## Hi there 👋

I'm João Otávio, a backend-focused developer from Brazil and a Software Engineering student.
I learn by building real projects step by step, with a strong focus on fundamentals, clarity, and clean code.


## 🚀 What I work with

I mainly build backend applications using **Java** and **Node.js**, focusing on:

- RESTful APIs
- Business logic and data flow
- SQL databases and data modeling
- Code readability and maintainability

My projects usually involve CRUD systems, API design, and backend structure rather than just isolated exercises.


## 🧠 Background

I have around one year of experience working in a **QA role**, where I was directly involved with **Java codebases**.
During this time, I:
- Fixed bugs in backend systems
- Reviewed Java code
- Worked closely with developers on real production flows

This gave me a solid understanding of how backend systems behave in real-world environments.


## 🔧 What I'm focusing on now

Currently, I'm deepening my backend skills by:
- Building and improving Java and Node.js APIs
- Strengthening my understanding of business rules and backend architecture
- Practicing clean code and better project organization

I aim to grow as a backend developer by consistently shipping projects and improving them over time.


## 📚 Currently learning

- Java (backend & APIs)
- Node.js
- SQL & relational databases
- Backend fundamentals and system design basics
