## Hi there 👋

My name is João Otávio. I'm a backend-focused developer from Brazil and a Software Engineering student. I like learning by doing and building things step by step, focusing on strong fundamentals rather than shortcuts.

## About my experience 🧠

I spent around one year working in a QA role, where I was directly involved with Java codebases. During this time, I fixed bugs, reviewed Java code, and worked closely with developers, which gave me a practical understanding of how backend systems behave in real environments.

## What I'm focusing on now 🚀

I'm currently focused on backend development using Java and Node.js. My main goal is to strengthen my understanding of APIs, business logic, data modeling, and clean code practices, while consistently building and improving projects.

## What I'm learning 📚

Alongside my Software Engineering studies, I'm deepening my knowledge in Java, Node.js, SQL, and general backend concepts. I consider myself at an early stage, but I'm intentional about learning the right way and building a solid foundation to grow as a developer.
